# Astro-Blasto, refactored

This project takes the astro-blasto example from the `ggez` crate and
refactors it to use an Entity-Component-System and an Event System.

The point is to develop the tools necessary to create a new game, namely
the ECS and Event System. It also provides a large amount of experience
working with `ggez`.

## The ECS

The entity-component-system is designed to have the same features, capabilities,
and workflows of the Unity entity-component-system.

It is heavily influenced by the Rustic-ECS (`recs`) crate.

## The Event System

TODO: Work on this.
